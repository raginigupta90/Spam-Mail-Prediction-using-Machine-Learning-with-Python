# Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning with Python

This project predicts whether an email is Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using machine learning techniques.

# Features

Classifies emails as Spam or Ham.

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing.

Implements feature extraction with TF-IDF Vectorizer.

# Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models

NLTK – Text preprocessing

NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

# Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-mail-prediction.git
cd spam-mail-prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

Prepare the dataset (spam.csv or similar).

Train the model:

python train_model.py


Test with sample emails:

python predict.py

Dataset

Commonly used dataset: [SpamAssassin / UCI SMS Spam Collection]

Contains email text and labels (spam or ham).

Model

Naive Bayes Classifier (MultinomialNB)

TF-IDF feature extraction for text classification.

# Example Output

Input: "You won $1000! Claim now!"

Prediction: Spam

# Future Enhancements

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit.

Add real-time email input integration.

Improve accuracy using deep learning (LSTM or BERT).
